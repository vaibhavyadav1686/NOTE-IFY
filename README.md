# NOTE-IFY : CONVERT YOUTUBE VIDEOS TO LECTURE NOTES IN MINUTES

## OVERVIEW
This project aims to create an AI-powered website using Python and Django ( to develop a RESTful API with a focus on the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) concept), incorporating Machine Learning (ML) techniques. The key features include a chatbot designed to address doubts related to lectures and the integration of various technologies such as OpenCV, NLTK, Google's speech recognition tool, PyTesseract, LipNet, and OpenAI for video, audio, and image processing, Natural Language Processing (NLP), speech recognition, Optical Character Recognition (OCR), lip reading, and chatbot implementation.

## FEATURES

### RESTful API with DRY Concept:

1. Utilized Python and Django to build a robust RESTful API.
2. Adhered to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle to enhance code maintainability and reduce redundancy.



### Chatbot for Lecture Doubts:

1. Implemented a chatbot functionality tailored to address doubts related to lectures.
2. Enhanced user engagement and provided a seamless platform for resolving queries.



### Multi-Faceted Processing:

#### 1. Video Processing with OpenCV:
Leveraged OpenCV for video processing, enabling advanced functionalities.
#### 2. Audio Processing with Google's Speech Recognition:
Integrated Google's speech recognition tool for accurate audio processing.
#### 3. Image Processing with PyTesseract:
Implemented PyTesseract for Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract text from images.
#### 4. Lip Reading with LipNet:
Tried to utilize LipNet for lip reading, enhancing accessibility for speech-impaired users.



### Natural Language Processing (NLP):

1. Employed NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) for advanced Natural Language Processing capabilities.
2. Enabled the system to understand and interpret text data effectively.



### Integration of OpenAI:

1. Utilized OpenAI for intelligent chatbot implementation, enhancing conversational abilities.
2. Improved user interaction and responsiveness through cutting-edge AI capabilities.
